U-Boot for Variscite VAR-SOM-MX6 / VAR-SOM-SOLO/DUAL / DART-MX6 boards
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This single U-Boot supports 3 different carrier boards:
VAR-MX6CustomBoard, VAR-SOLOCustomBoard and VAR-DT6CustomBoard,
and 3 different SOM types: VAR-SOM-MX6, VAR-SOM-SOLO/DUAL and DART-MX6
(DART-MX6 goes with VAR-DT6CustomBoard, and the others can be mixed).

Each SOM type can come in various configurations (can be with
different CPU types and frequencies, can be with or without eMMC,
can be with different types and capacities of NAND, RAM, etc.)

Building U-Boot
---------------

$ make mrproper

Choose one of the following:
$ make mx6var_som_sd_defconfig			# For booting from SD card/eMMC
$ make mx6var_som_nand_defconfig		# For booting from NAND flash
$ make mx6var_som_sd_SECURE_BOOT_defconfig	# For booting from SD card/eMMC with secure boot support
$ make mx6var_som_nand_SECURE_BOOT_defconfig	# For booting from NAND flash with secure boot support
$ make mx6var_som_sd_android_defconfig		# For booting from SD card/eMMC (Android)
$ make mx6var_som_nand_android_defconfig	# For booting from NAND flash (Android)

$ make


Flashing U-Boot to an SD card
-----------------------------

- After the 'make' command completes, flash the generated SPL & U-Boot
binaries into the SD card:

$ sudo dd if=SPL of=/dev/sdX bs=1K seek=1; sync
$ sudo dd if=u-boot.img of=/dev/sdX bs=1K seek=69; sync

(replace /dev/sdX with your correct device node)

- Insert the SD card into the slot

- Connect the debug cable to the host PC

- Make sure the boot select is on SD
(by pressing the boot select button on VAR-MX6CustomBoard while powering up,
or by toggling a DIP switch on VAR-SOLOCustomBoard / VAR-DT6CustomBoard)

- Power up the board and U-Boot messages will appear in the serial console.
